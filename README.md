# kubeLLM 🤖

KubeLLM is an LLM-based multi-agent framework that manages your kubernetes clusters all on its own. KubeLLM takes in ONE formatted prompt and it will automatically diagnose and apply fixes to Kubernetes configuration issues.

### Instructions to Run 🏃💨
1. Navigate to KubeLLM directory and install software dependencies as follows:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Make sure Kubernetes (MiniKube) is up and running.
3. Start the PgVector database using the following command:
   docker run -d \\   
  -e POSTGRES_DB=ai \\   
  -e POSTGRES_USER=ai \\   
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=ai \\   
  -e PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata \\   
  -v pgvolume:/var/lib/postgresql/data \\   
  -p 5532:5432 \\   
  --name pgvector \\   
  phidata/pgvector:16

4. Start the Knowledge Agent with RAG capability by running the **bash start_apiserver.sh**.
5. Once you have the Knowledge Agent running in the background or another terminal, change directory to debug_assistant_latest.
6. Optional: if you need to run a single test case only
   ***python3 main.py ~/KubeLLM/debug_assistant_latest/troubleshooting/TEST_CASE_NAME/config_step.json.***
7. You may need to update config to contain the right paths. *(Note : This will be updated in a future update)*
8. Finally, just sit back and let KubeLLM do all of the work. Make sure to teardown the environment after each individual test case run.
   ***python3 teardownenv.py TEST_CASE_NAME***

### Instructions to Run Tests 📝
Simply navigate to the kube_test.py file in debug_assistant_latest folder and run the test.
```
  python3 kube_test.py
```

### Agents 🕵️‍♀️
Currently our approach uses two agents, one for knowledge and one that takes corrective actions recommended by the knowledge agent. The knowledge agent uses a pgvector database and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique to store and retrieve relevant knowledge, which primarily consists of Kubernetes documentation.

* Our approach is currently based off this graph here [Kubernetes Troubleshooting Graph](https://learnk8s.io/troubleshooting-deployments)
